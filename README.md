This only works on Unity only!

1. After you downloaded the file in Unity you should find a Player-Movement C# script.
2. Drag it on your first person player THEN adjust the settings to your liking.
3. For the Ground Check Transform create a Empty Object as a child under your First-Person-Player.
4. Then name it GroundCheckTransform.
5. After that adjust the GroundCheckTransform exactly under your First-Person-Player then it should work perfectly.
